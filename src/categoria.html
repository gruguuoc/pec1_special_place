                            <p>
                                In Jujutsu Kaisen, Shibuya is an important location in the anime and manga series, particularly during the Shibuya Incident arc, one of the most intense and pivotal storylines in the series.
                                While the district of Shibuya in Tokyo is a real, bustling, and fashionable area known for its bright lights, shopping, and youth culture, in Jujutsu Kaisen, it becomes the focal point of a large-scale battle between Jujutsu Sorcerers and Cursed Spirits.
