                        <p>
                            In the movie The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006), the scene where Shibuya appears is presented as a key part of the vibrant and chaotic atmosphere of Tokyo.
                            Although it is not a "main scene" dedicated exclusively to Shibuya, this area of the city plays an important role in the context of the drifting culture and the urban lifestyle that the film portrays.

                        <p>
                            In Jujutsu Kaisen, Shibuya is an important location in the anime and manga series, particularly during the Shibuya Incident arc, one of the most intense and pivotal storylines in the series.
                            While the district of Shibuya in Tokyo is a real, bustling, and fashionable area known for its bright lights, shopping, and youth culture, in Jujutsu Kaisen, it becomes the focal point of a large-scale battle between Jujutsu Sorcerers and Cursed Spirits.

                            In Godzilla: Final Wars (2004), Shibuya plays a key role as the site of a major battle between Godzilla and other monsters.
                            Its destruction highlights the scale of the threat and serves as a symbol of human resistance against the chaos unleashed by the creatures.
