                        <h2>Context and Origin of the Arc</h2>
                            The Shibuya Incident takes place after the events of the Jujutsu High Selection Exam Arc and unfolds in Shibuya, one of the busiest and most iconic districts of Tokyo.
                            In this arc, the Jujutsu sorcerers and cursed spirits face off in an all-out battle, where the stakes are higher than ever.
                            The story begins when a group of cursed spirits, led by Suguru Geto, a former sorcerer turned enemy of humanity, sets into motion a plan to trap the most powerful sorcerers within the district and unleash chaos.
