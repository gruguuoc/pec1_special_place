                    <p>
                        To get to Shibuya by public transportation, the easiest way is to take the JR Yamanote Line, one of Tokyo’s most popular and convenient train lines.
                        The Yamanote Line connects key stations across the city, including Shinjuku, Shibuya, Ikebukuro, and Tokyo Station, making it a fast and reliable option for travelers.
                        Once you arrive at Shibuya Station, you'll find multiple exits, and the station itself is a major hub with connections to buses, taxis, and other train lines.
                        The Yamanote Line is especially convenient if you're coming from other major districts in Tokyo, such as Shinjuku or Harajuku.
                        <br><br>
                        If you prefer the subway, there are a few other options to consider. The Hanzomon Line runs from Kanda Station to Shibuya, providing a direct route to the district. Alternatively, the Ginza Line also has a stop at Shibuya Station, which is great if you're coming from the Asakusa or Ueno areas. Both subway lines are well-connected to other parts of Tokyo, and using them can be a good choice if you're already near one of their stations.
                        Whether you're taking the train or the subway, getting to Shibuya is simple, and once there, you'll be right in the heart of one of Tokyo's most dynamic neighborhoods.
